This repo is my attempt to use Go to make a simple web app that has multiple pages you can navigate to.

The app will consist of the following:
- A home page with a list of novels that are in the public domain.
- links for each novel that navigate to their own static web page
- each static page will have a synopisis of the novel and it's publishin details.
- each novel page will will have link to an author page that that has a bio of the author.

This is the first step in larger project.
